"All Loaders have an extension point called ``preprocess``, which is a "
"method you can override and perform operations on each record from the "
"Loader. ``preprocess`` method takes only 1 argument, which is a single "
"record loaded (dict-like object). The method must return the preprocessed"
" dict-like object or ``None``."

"The default implementation of ``preprocess`` method is as follows; it "
"does nothing."

"Although not mandatory, the output of ``preprocess`` method should be a "
"flat dict-like object, i.e., values should not be objects."

"For example, if you want to process JSONL files (files that contain one "
"JSON record per line), you can create a class that inherits from "
":py:class:`LineBasedFileLoader <jubakit.loader.core.LineBasedFileLoader>`"
" which loads a single text file and emits record for each line, and "
"implement ``preprocess`` method as follows:"

"You can also use ``preprocess`` method for filtering. If you want to skip"

"If you are developing *infinite* Loader (e.g., Twitter streams), it "
