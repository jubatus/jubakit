"``jubamodel`` is a command line utility to perform low-level manipulation"
" of model files. If you are wishing for high-level, user friendly output "
"of models, use ``jubadump`` command instead. Unlike ``jubadump``, "
"``jubamodel`` is service-independent; you can use ``jubamodel`` for any "
"services."
